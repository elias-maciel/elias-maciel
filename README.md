## About me üçé

Hello! My name is **Elias Maciel**. I am a student of **Applied and Computational Mathematics** and I work as a **Quantitative Developer (Quant Dev)**.  
I have a strong interest in **mathematical modeling** and **quantitative solutions** for the financial market.  
I am always seeking to improve my skills, exploring new tools, programming languages, and innovative approaches to tackle complex problems.

## Projects and Studies

Here are some projects (or areas of study) I have explored and plan to share in the future:

1. **Risk Modeling**  
   - Risk analysis in investment portfolios using Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall.  
   - Statistical and computational methods to quantify uncertainties.

2. **Algorithmic Trading Strategies**  
   - Development of automated trading strategies.  
   - Robustness testing, parameter optimization, and performance backtesting.

3. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Application of ARIMA, GARCH, Prophet, and other models for price and volatility forecasting.  
   - Evaluation of various error metrics and construction of probabilistic scenarios.

4. **Statistics and Machine Learning**  
   - Application of regression, classification, and clustering methods to everyday problems.  
   - Utilization of libraries such as **scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch** for machine learning solutions.

> *I plan to add repositories with practical examples and tutorials on these topics soon.*

## Tech Stack

In my daily routine, I use a variety of languages and frameworks, including:

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly, etc.)
- **C++** (for high-performance solutions, when needed)
- **Git/GitHub** (version control and collaboration)
- **Docker** (application containerization)
- **LaTeX** (for technical reports and articles)
- **SQL** (database manipulation and queries)

I am always open to learning new technologies that can add value to my quantitative analysis projects.
